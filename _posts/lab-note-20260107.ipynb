    "  **Species:** Xiphophorus maculatus, medaka, zebrafish and amphibians\n",
    "  **Mechanism:**  Via partial sequencing of a testis cDNA library from the poeciliid fish Xiphophorus maculatus, we have identified a new member of the makorin gene family, that we called mkrn4. In addition to the already described mkrn1 and mkrn2, mkrn4 is the third example of a makorin gene present in both tetrapods and ray-finned fish. However, this gene was not detected in mouse and rat, suggesting its loss in the lineage leading to rodent murids. Mkrn2 and mkrn4 are located in large ancient duplicated regions in tetrapod and fish genomes, suggesting the possible involvement of ancestral vertebrate-specific genome duplication in the formation of these genes. Intriguingly, many mkrn1 and mkrn2 intronless retrocopies have been detected in mammals but not in other vertebrates, most of them corresponding to pseudogenes. The nature and number of zinc fingers were found to be conserved in Mkrn1 and Mkrn2 but much more variable in Mkrn4, with lineage-specific differences. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated a highly gonad-biased expression pattern for makorin genes in medaka and zebrafish (ray-finned fishes) and amphibians, but a strong relaxation of this specificity in birds and mammals. All three mkrn genes were maternally expressed before zygotic genome activation in both medaka and zebrafish early embryos.\n",

    "  **Species:** Drosophila  \n",
    "  **Mechanism:** Mkrn1 interacts with poly(A) binding protein (pAbp) and binds specifically to osk 3’ UTR in a region adjacent to A-rich sequences. Mkrn1 controls embryonic patterning and germ cell formation by specifically activating osk translation, most likely by competing with Bru1 to bind to osk 3’ UTR.  \n",

    "  **Mechanism:** The pseudogene of Mkrn1, called Mkrn-p1, regulates stability of the Mkrn1 mRNA in trans. Transgenic mice with reduced transcription of Mkrn1-p1 manifested polycystic kidneys and bone deformity. However, it was shown later that Mkrn1-p1 is fully methylated on both alleles; it is not transcribed and, therefore, cannot stabilize Mkrn1 transcripts in trans. Moreover, none of the phenotypes caused by a partial reduction of Mkrn1 in mutant mice were seen in the mutants with direct Mkrn1 disruption. \n",
